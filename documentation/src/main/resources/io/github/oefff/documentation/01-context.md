## Context


#### Background ####

Some agile/scrum team want to do somekind of BDD and want to use [Cucumber] for Acceptance Test.
Therefor they need [Gherkin] `feature files`, preferably being written or, at least,
 reviewed and approved by a Product Owner or Business Analist.
 
To use those feature files as the source for `executable specifications` they need to be part of the test suite;
 Hence they need to be managed just like the other code artifcts and stored in the Source Code Management System.
But it isn't very likely that Business People will start to use text editors, Git clients and resolve merge conflicts.

So we need a different solution: **Oefff** 
 
#### Context for Oefff #### 

The purpose of **Oefff** is to provide  **Business People** the abilit to read, write and verify Cucumber Feature Files.
