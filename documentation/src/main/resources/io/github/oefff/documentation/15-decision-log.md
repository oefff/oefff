## Decision Log


<dl>
  <dt>2018-06-04: Multi-project Workspace</dt>
  <dd>
    Oefff is going to be 'multi-project'.<br />
    A running version of Oefff should be able to host multiple projects.<br />
    Each project should be able to have it's own configuration.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>2018-04-10: Documentation via Structurizr</dt>
  <dd>
    Oefff itself is going to be an example project for both using Oefff and how to 
    document a project using the C4-model and the "software guidebook" concept.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>2018-04-02: Start the project</dt>
  <dd>
    I'm going to build a webapp, which will offer a spiffy GUI and awesome UX to Business People for managing Cucumber Features
   </dd>
